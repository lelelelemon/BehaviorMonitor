  <para>
    This chapter discusses a number of typical fine-tuning scenarios for &PROD; clustering
    algorithms. Some of the scenarios are relevant to all &PROD; algorithms, while others
    are specific to individual algorithms.

    <title>Desirable characteristics of documents for clustering</title>
    
    <para>
      The quality of clusters and their labels largely depends on the 
      characteristics of documents provided on the input. Although there is no general
      rule for optimum document content, below are some tips worth considering.

          <para>
            The most important characteristic of &PROD; algorithms to keep in mind is
            that they perform in-memory clustering. For this reason, as a rule of
            thumb, &PROD; should successfully deal with up to a thousand of
            documents, a few paragraphs each. For algorithms designed to process
            millions of documents, you may want to check out the 
            <link xlink:href="http://lucene.apache.org/mahout/">Mahout</link> project.

          <para>
            &PROD; clustering algorithms will work best with a set of documents similar
            to what is normally returned by a typical search engine. While about 20 is the
            minimum number of documents you can reasonably cluster, the optimum would fall
            in the 100 &ndash; 500 range.

          <para>
            If the input documents are a result of some search query, provide
            contextual snippets related to that query, similar
            to what web search engines return, instead of full document content. Not only
            will this speed up processing, but also should help the clustering
            algorithm to cover the full spectrum of topics dealt with in the search results.

          <title>Minimize "noise" in the input documents.</title>
          
          <para>
            All kinds of "noise" in the documents, such as truncated sentences (sometimes resulting from 
            contextual snippet extraction suggested above) or random alphanumerical strings
            may decrease the quality of cluster labels. If you have access to e.g. a few
            sentences' abstract of each document, it is worth checking the quality of 
            clustering based on those abstracts. If you can combine this with the
            previous tip, i.e. extract complete sentences matching user's query, this
            should improve the clusters even further.

    <title>Choosing the clustering algorithm</title>
    
    <para>
      Currently, &PROD; offers two specialized search results clustering algorithms:
      Lingo and STC as well as an implementation of the bisecting k-means clustering. 
      The algorithms differ in terms of the main clustering principle and 
      hence have different quality and performance characteristics. This section describes
      briefly the algorithms and provides some recommendations for choosing the
      most suitable one.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      The key characteristic of the <emphasis role="bold">Lingo</emphasis> algorithm is that it reverses the traditional 
      clustering pipeline: it first identifies cluster labels and only then assigns documents
      to the labels to form final clusters. To find the labels, Lingo builds a 
      <link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-term_matrix">term-document matrix</link>
      for all input documents and decomposes the matrix to obtain a number of base vectors 
      that well approximate the matrix in a low-dimensional space. Each such vector
      gives rise to one cluster label. To complete the clustering process, each label is
      assigned documents that contain the label's words.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      The key data structure used in the <emphasis role="bold">Suffix Tree Clustering (STC)</emphasis> algorithm is a 
      <link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalised_suffix_tree">Generalized Suffix Tree (GST)</link>
      built for all input documents. The algorithm traverses the GST to identify words and 
      phrases that occurred more than once in the input documents. Each such word or phrase
      gives rise to one <emphasis>base cluster</emphasis>. The last stage of the clustering 
      process is merging base clusters to form the final clusters.
    </para>

    <para>
      The two algorithms have two features in common. They both create overlapping 
      clusterings, in which one document can be assigned to more than one cluster. Also,
      in case of both algorithms a certain number of documents can remain unclustered and 
      fall in the .
    </para>
    
    <para>
      Bisecting k-means is a generic clustering algorithm that can also be applied to clustering
      textual data. As opposed to Lingo and STC, bisecting k-means creates non-overlapping clusters
      and does not produce the <emphasis>Other Topics</emphasis> group. Its current limitation
      is that it labels clusters using individual words and not all cluster's documents may
      correspond to the words included in the cluster label.

      It is difficult to give one clear recommendation as to which algorithm is "better".
      Many people feel Lingo delivers better-formed and more diverse clusters at the cost of
      lower performance and scalability. The ultimate judgment, however, should based on 
      the evaluation with the specific document collection. <xref linkend="table.lingo-stc-recommendations" />

      The <emphasis>Other Topics</emphasis> cluster contains documents that do not belong

      By tuning parameters of the clustering algorithm, you can reduce the number of
